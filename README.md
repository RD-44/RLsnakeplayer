# RLsnakeplayer
 Using Pytorch to train an agent to play snake using DQN.

How to use:
- Run the agent.py file to see the model play and learn the snake game
- Architecture for the model can be tweaked in model.py
- model is saved in the model folder every 10 games of training
- Setup a virtual environment and install the packages in requirements.txt before running

Credits go to patrickloeber for providing a tutorial and the underlying snake game implemented using pygame
I have further tweaked his implementation with optimisations and switched the model to double dqn
